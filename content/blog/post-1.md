## Tasting
### Classic 
(A peace of Ice, Gin + Tonic)

### Signature Serve
The recommended serve of the destillery:
* 40ml Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin
* 120ml Chilled Premium Tonic
* Wedge of Fresh Red Grapefruit

What I like in this signature serve is the support of citrus taste with the grapefruite wedge. The tonic needs to play a minor role as the fruits cary the bitternes. All in all other then expected from a Irish drink, this comes with a freshness and energising kick. 

I asume that in case you have not a grapefruit around a sligghtly bitter or citrus heavy tonic can tell the same story.
