Well, what to say about me? On day I'm guiding companies to the [cloud](wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Computing), playing with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and being excited about tech. At night I like to dry and test different Gins, Rums and co.

However, this blog/library/remember page is supposed to talk about different drinks I like or don't like. 

## Drink responsible!
I do not support underage drinking, excessive drinking, binge drinking or any other unsafe drinking behavior. Always drink responsibly. DO NOT drink and drive while or after consuming alcohol. Who drives public transport is anyhow 1000x cooler ;)

But seriously, if you feel addicted to alcohol, drink every day or have already the whish in the morning to consume alcohol, then please search for local help.
