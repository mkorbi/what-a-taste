# What a taste 
A blog/library/reminder to my self of nice & tasty stuff. I'm happy for every recommendation :)
The blog is about the indulgence of different drinks, mainly Gin, maybe Rum and sometimes other drinks.

## Drink Responsible
I do not support underage drinking, excessive drinking, binge drinking or any other unsafe drinking behavior. Always drink responsibly. DO NOT drink and drive while or after consuming alcohol. Who drives public transport is anyhow 1000x cooler ;)

If you need help as you maybe feel addicted to alcohol please search for help.
